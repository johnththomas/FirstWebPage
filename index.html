            <div class="para">
                <p>Kerala is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. The state is situated between Arabian Sea to the west and Western Ghats mountain ranges to the east. Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's Greatest Places. <p> With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state while a major chunk of the population can speak and understand English. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity.</p>
                   
                <p>The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. </p>
